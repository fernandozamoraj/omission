# omission
omission is an exception handler framework.

Handling exceptions in your application can get unrully and can become quite a jungle of many different approaches.  

Omission aims to eliminate all that clutter by uniformly handling exceptions.  Omission is pluggable which means that you can plug a logging framework of your choice.
